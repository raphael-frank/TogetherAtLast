Together At Last is a university project for the course 'Introduction to Computer Science for Games Engineering' in February 2023. It's a multiplayer platformer where two players, one as a fire blob and one as a water blob, must work together to overcome various obstacles using their unique abilities to reach the end.

The game was developed over a span of three weeks using the Unity Engine by a team of three individuals. I was responsible for developing the network backend to facilitate online gameplay as both a host and a client. Additionally, I designed the game's menu and created the lava/water pit level.
